const messageContent = `Final Hidden Message ðŸ’Œâœ¨ â€“ Straight from My Heart
Ruddu Rani, I donâ€™t know where to start because thereâ€™s so much I want to say, and yet, no words feel enough to express how much I miss you... how much I still love you.
Every single day with you is a blessing of god.
I find myself going back to our memories and all those moments where you made me feel like the luckiest person in the world.
I never thought Iâ€™d know a love so pure, so deep, so irreplaceableâ€”until I met you.
You were never just someone special to me, Ruddu... you are my world, my home, my peace.
No matter how much time passes, my heart will always belong to you.
I miss your voice, your laughter, your angry little face, your long love paragraphs, your warmth... I miss us.
Maybe fate pulled us apart for a while, but I refuse to believe our story will end.
Because real love doesnâ€™t just fade away.
And what we hadâ€”what we haveâ€”is real.
So Iâ€™m here, standing in front of you, with nothing but my heart in my hands, asking you one last timeâ€¦
Will you be my wifey again, Ruddu Rani? Will you let me love you forever, the way I always have? ðŸ’™âœ¨`;
