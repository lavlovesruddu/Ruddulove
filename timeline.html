            <div class="event" onclick="showNote('It all started on the bus, you were teaching me chemistry, explaining concepts with that soft, mesmerizing voice of yours. But honestly, I wasn’t paying attention to chemistry—I was lost in you. The way you spoke, the way your eyes lit up while explaining… at that moment, I knew you were different. Even before we talked, I used to sit behind you, quietly admiring you from afar. I never had the courage to speak, but from that day, fate decided to bring us closer. That first conversation was not just about chemistry—it was the beginning of our chemistry ')">

            <div class="event" onclick="showNote('A moment that still makes my heart race. I still remember that day, i took you from school. You were sitting behind me on the scooty, holding on, just like always. The air was filled with something special, something unspoken. I asked you if we should do that i was uncertain of the answer but it was the best feeling when you said yes we can kiss , then we went to that place where we kissed i remember that so well and then, it happened—our first kiss. Right there, on the scooty. It wasn’t just a kiss; it was a promise, an unspoken vow that we belonged together. Even now, every time I ride the scooty, I can still feel you there, as if time never moved forward from that perfect moment. Our first kiss was magical, right there on the scooty! 💋')">

            <div class="event" onclick="showNote('🎬 A movie, a song, and a moment I’ll never forget. Our first movie date was supposed to be just a simple outing, but it turned into something unforgettable.  Watching Animal together, I could feel your emotions through every scene. But then came Satranga—that song changed everything. I looked at you, and you had tears in your eyes. When I asked why you didnt tell me at that time but when you told, your answer hit me deep: (I cried because I was scared of losing you). In that moment, I realized just how much you loved me, how deeply you felt for me. It wasn’t just a movie; it was a moment where I truly saw your heart, and I knew—I never wanted to be without you')">

I could never afford to loose you. And you at that time my Pyaari Ruddu you cheered me up plating Humma Humma Song i was just so happy and grateful to god that you came to my life.
