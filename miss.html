            <div class="miss-box" onclick="revealText(this)"><span class="hidden-text">The Way You Treated Me, Especially with Your Words 🗣️💞 You had a way with words—every sentence you spoke to me felt like it was wrapped in love. Even when you were scolding me or teasing me, I could feel the care behind it. The way you always chose your words carefully, making sure I never felt hurt, made me realize how deeply you loved me.</span></div>
            <div class="miss-box" onclick="revealText(this)"><span class="hidden-text">All Those Goodnight Texts 🌙💘 Every night ended the same way—a sweet goodnight text from you. Sometimes short and simple, sometimes filled with love, but always there. It was a small thing, but it meant the world to me. Now, my nights feel incomplete without them.</span></div>
            <div class="miss-box" onclick="revealText(this)"><span class="hidden-text">Your Big Paragraphs to Express Love 📜❤️ I still remember the long messages you used to send me—paragraphs filled with love, emotions, and the most beautiful words. You never held back when it came to expressing how much I meant to you. Reading them always made my heart so full. I miss those messages, but more than that, I miss the love behind them.</span></div>
            <div class="miss-box" onclick="revealText(this)"><span class="hidden-text">The Way You Made Me Feel Appreciated 🥰✨ You always made sure I knew my worth, that I felt special, that I knew I was loved. Whether it was through your words, your actions, or just the way you looked at me—you made me feel like I was the most important person in the world. And now, without them, there’s an emptiness that nothing else can fill.</span></div>
